```ts
const DynamicMap = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/properties/PropertyMap'),
  {
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => <Skeleton className='h-[400px] w-full' />,
  }
);
return <DynamicMap countryCode={property.country} />;
```

Lazy Loading: Components wrapped with dynamic are lazy loaded. This means that the component code is not loaded until it is needed. For example, if you have a component that is only visible when a user clicks a button, you could use dynamic to ensure that the code for that component is not loaded until the button is clicked.

Server Side Rendering (SSR) Control: By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that it generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of doing it all on the client-side. However, with dynamic, you can control this behavior. You can choose to disable SSR for specific modules, which can be useful for modules that have client-side dependencies.
